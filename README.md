## **Sefer Bora Lişesivdin**, Professor of Physics, PhD, SMIEEE

## About
I'm a physics engineer academic with over twenty years of experience.

I'm living in Ankara, Türkiye. I am married and a father of a lovely boy.

## Work
Presently, I am working as a faculty member at [Gazi University](https://www.gazi.edu.tr) [Department of Physics](https://fizik.gazi.edu.tr/). I am the head of the sub-department of Condensed Matter Physics. In addition, I am the principal investigator of [Low-Dimensional Materials and Systems Research Group](https://lrgresearch.org), where we work on experimental and computational investigations of low-dimensional or bulk systems with defects and impurities.
